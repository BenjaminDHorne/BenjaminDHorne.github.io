        <p>I am the CCI Board of Visitors Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://sis.utk.edu/">School of Information Sciences</a> in the College of Communication and Information at The University of Tennessee Knoxville. I am also a Joint Faculty Assistant Professor in <a href="https://bredesencenter.utk.edu/">The Bredesen Center's</a> Data Science and Engineering program, a Founding Fellow of the <a href="https://ric.utk.edu/information-integrity-institute/people/">CCI Information Integrity Institute</a>, an Affiliate of the Center for National Security and Foreign Affairs at <a href="https://baker.utk.edu/research-centers/nsfa/">the Baker School for Public Policy and Public Affairs</a>, and co-director of <a href="https://melalab.github.io/">The MeLa Lab</a>, a multi-university lab that works on problems related to online news and media.
        <br><br>
        I am a highly interdisciplinary, computational social scientist who takes a pragmatic approach to research. I study the <b>production of, consumption of, and interventions to misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, rumors, and malign influence in media ecosystems</b>, sometimes relating to broader concerns of U.S. national security.<br><br>
       	This work fits into two related categories:</b><br><br>
	<b>1.</b> Content moderation and information interventions, ranging from automated detection techniques (or alternatives to automated techniques) to content warning label designs. I prioritize ethics, safety, and practicality over building narrowly accurate tools.​<br>
	Examples: <a href="/pdfs/Ethical and safety considerations in automated fake news detection.pdf">BIT23</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3460350">CACM22</a>, <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3226">ICWSM19a</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3363818">TIST19</a><br><br>
	
	<b>2.</b> Media ecosystems, where media is defined broadly and can include news media, social media actors, and social media platforms. Importantly, I am not only referring to media consumption but also media production. For example, asking "what tactics does fringe news outlet X use to spread information?" is just as important as asking "how does fringe news outlet X change consumers' opinions?".<br>
	Examples: <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19305">ICWSM22</a>, <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3227">ICWSM19b</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3501247.3531571">Websci22</a>, <a href="pdfs/VAW_ICWSM24.pdf">ICWSM24</a><br><br>

	In addition to this core work, I collaborate with social scientists to study the relationships between and influences of culture, identity, and experiences on opinions, with the long-term goal of using what is learned from this work to inform my work on media ecosystems and interventions.<br>
	Examples:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01670-6">HSSC23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01489">SNSS24</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666622723000503">CRESP23</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10597123231186432">AB23</a><br><br>

	I like to think about this work within what I call the "disinformation pipeline", where I study various facets of media, the humans who consume it, and interventions in between (shown in the Figure below). While I call this a "disinformation" pipeline, it can also be applied to other related terms, such as online influencers.

	My background is in Computer Science. Hence, methodologically, I am most experienced in using computational methods from <b>natural language processing</b>, <b>network science</b>, and <b>machine learning</b> on digital trace data. However, I often design human experiments and employ qualitative methods on both digital trace data and survey data to aid my research.
	<br><br>
	I publish under Benjamin D. Horne, but everyone calls me Ben.
	<br><br>
	Outside of academia, I spend much of my time collecting sports cards and memorabilia. I have particular expertise in vintage rookie cards and autographs from hall of famers in football, basketball, and hockey. What I most enjoy about this hobby is that sports cards – like sports media -, when thought about within their historical context, can uniquely capture moments in time and culture.

	Here is a Pecha-Kucha talk (<a href="https://www.pechakucha.com/about">20 slides x 20 seconds</a>) I gave at UT Mic/Nite in 2024 on if we should let AI tell us what is true:
