        <p>I am the CCI Board of Visitors Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://sis.utk.edu/">School of Information Sciences</a> in the College of Communication and Information at The University of Tennessee Knoxville. I am also a Joint Faculty Assistant Professor in <a href="https://bredesencenter.utk.edu/">The Bredesen Center's</a> Data Science and Engineering program, a Founding Fellow of the <a href="https://ric.utk.edu/information-integrity-institute/people/">CCI Information Integrity Institute</a>, an Affiliate of the Center for National Security and Foreign Affairs at <a href="https://baker.utk.edu/research-centers/nsfa/">the Baker School for Public Policy and Public Affairs</a>.         

<br><br> 

I am a highly interdisciplinary, computational social scientist who broadly studies <b>media ecosystems</b>. I typically study <b>trust</b> in these ecosystems, particularly when <b>information interventions</b> are introduced. I like to think about this work within the pipeline shown in the Figure below, where I study various facets of media production, the humans who consume it, and interventions in between.

I use the term "ecosystem” because today’s media is produced and consumed on highly technical networked systems, and these systems continue to change over time - both in terms of the technology deployed and how people use or abuse those technologies. Since media, people, and technology have become tightly intertwined, this work requires in-depth technical knowledge that is grounded in history, culture, and politics. 

<br><br> 

 My background is in Computer Science. Hence, methodologically, I am most experienced in using computational methods from <b>natural language processing</b>, <b>network science</b>, and <b>machine learning</b> on digital trace data. However, I often design human experiments and employ qualitative methods on both digital trace data and survey data to aid my research.

	Outside of academia, I spend much of my time collecting vintage sports cards, programs, and memorabilia. After many years of collecting, I have particular expertise in rookie cards and autographs from hall of famers in football, basketball, and hockey.  I sometimes talk about this collection on Instagram @TheProfessorsCards. 

	<br><br> 
	Here is a Pecha-Kucha talk (<a href="https://www.pechakucha.com/about">20 slides x 20 seconds</a>) I gave at UT Mic/Nite in 2024 on if we should let AI tell us what is true:
